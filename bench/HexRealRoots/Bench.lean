Benchmark registrations for `hex-real-roots`.

This Phase 4 slice measures the certified real-root isolation surface: the
two isolation engines through the public `isolate?`/`isolateSturm?` drivers,
the Sturm-chain and sign-variation primitives, the Möbius transform, the
`rootBound`/`sepPrec` closed forms, and the `refineTo` refinement loop.

Every timed target returns a compact integer checksum built from the dyadic
endpoints of the isolation output (`dyadicKey`), the chain coefficients, or
the scalar result, so the harness's hash column doubles as a
cross-implementation conformance check.

Input families (per `HexRealRoots/SPEC/hex-real-roots.md` §"Time budgets" and the
conformance §"local" tier). `isolate?` is deliberately exercised on three
structurally different families, never a single happy-path shape:

* `well-separated-products`: `∏_{k=1}^{n} (x − k)`, `n` unit-separated integer
  roots. The Descartes engine's easy regime; resolves in `O(n + log(bound/gap))`
  bisection levels.
* `chebyshev-clustered`: the degree-`n` Chebyshev polynomial `T_n` built from
  the integer recurrence `T_{k+1} = 2x·T_k − T_{k-1}`. Its `n` real roots
  cluster near `±1` with gaps `~ 1/n²`, so bisection must descend deeper.
* `mignotte-worst-case`: `xⁿ − (a·x − 1)²` with `a = 1000`, the textbook
  Descartes worst case — a close real root pair that keeps Descartes variation
  counts at their maximum until the interval width shrinks to the order of the
  separation. This is the family that realises the SPEC's worst-case
  `O(n²·(h + log n))` Möbius-transform bound.

`compare runIsolateDescartesFirst runIsolateSturm` (shared
`well-separated-products` domain) is the intentional cross-engine equivalence
check: `isolate?` runs Descartes-first, `isolateSturm?` is the certified
fallback, and both must hash-agree on the isolation endpoints at every common
degree.

External comparator: SageMath `real_roots` / python-flint (the SPEC's oracle
role list) is `informational`, structurally different (approximate/native
vs the certified exact-integer engine), and scheduled-only — not wired in this
PR. See `libraries.yml: HexRealRoots.phase4.comparators`.

Genericity matters: the polynomial-remainder sequence of a generic dense
polynomial is *normal* (the degree drops by exactly one per pseudo-division),
so `sturmChain` attains full length `deg + 1` and the fixture exercises the
whole remainder sequence — a structured (e.g. periodic small-coefficient)
fixture collapses to an `O(1)`-length chain and benches a best-case input.
Probed shape on this generator: chain length `n + 3` at every measured rung,
with primitive-chain coefficient growth ≈ 31 bits per degree (the SPEC's
`O(n·h)`-bit growth). -/

/- `isolate?` on `∏(x−k)`. SPEC §"Complexity contract": well-separated roots
resolve in `O(n + log(rootBound/gap))` bisection levels; with `O(n)` unresolved
intervals per level that is `O(n²)` Möbius transforms, each an `O(n²)` integer
Taylor shift, so `O(n⁴)` integer operations. Coefficient growth of `∏(x−k)`
(`h ~ n log n` bits) is an additional bignum factor carried by the constant. -/

/- `isolate?` on `T_n`. The clustered roots near `±1` (gaps `~1/n²`) force
`O(log n)` extra bisection levels versus the well-separated family, but the
dominant asymptotic is still `O(n²)` Möbius transforms of `O(n²)` cost each,
i.e. `O(n⁴)`; coefficient magnitude `~2^n` (`h ~ n`) is the bignum factor. -/

  }

/- `isolate?` on the Mignotte worst case. SPEC §"Complexity contract": bisection
depth is `O(n·(h + log n))` and each node is one `O(n²)` Möbius transform. The
Mignotte polynomial has `O(1)` real roots (the close pair), so the bisection
tree width is `O(1)` and the node count is `O(depth) = O(n)` at fixed `a`
(`h = O(log a)` constant), giving `O(n³)` integer operations. The SPEC's wider
`O(n²·(h + log n))` transform bound needs `Θ(n)` simultaneously-clustered roots
(the Chebyshev family); the Mignotte pair stresses transform depth and the
large-`a` coefficient magnitude rather than transform count. -/

domain with `runIsolateSturm`; same `O(n⁴)` textbook model as
`runIsolateWellSep` since it is the same driver on the same inputs. -/

  }

/- Compare leg (certified Sturm engine). Same shared domain. Each of the
`O(n²)` bisection nodes evaluates the *whole* Sturm chain — `O(n)` elements of
total degree `O(n²)` — and the primitive chain's coefficients grow to `O(n·h)`
bits (SPEC §"Complexity contract"), so each node's bignum evaluation carries an
extra factor of `O(n)` over the Descartes engine's bounded-coefficient Möbius
transform: `O(n²)` nodes × `O(n²)` Horner × `O(n)` bit-growth = `O(n⁵)`. This
super-`O(n⁴)` cost is exactly why `isolate?` runs Descartes first; the compare's
relative-timing summary makes the gap concrete. -/

  }

/- `sturmChain`. SPEC §"Complexity contract": `O(n)` pseudo-divisions, each
`O(n²)` coefficient operations, so `O(n³)` coefficient operations total. On the
normal (full-length) remainder sequence the primitive-chain coefficients grow
to `O(n·h)` bits (SPEC, ≈ 31 bits/degree probed on this fixture), so the GMP
per-coefficient cost transitions from flat (allocation-dominated) below the
schedule to multiplication-bound above it; the registered schedule spans the
downstream-realistic degree band where the `O(n³)` contract is what wall clock
sees. Below the floor the boxed-scalar regime deflates the local slope, past
the ceiling subquadratic GMP multiplication takes over. -/

    signalFloorMultiplier := 1.0
  }

/- `sturmVarAt`. SPEC §"Complexity contract": one exact Horner evaluation per
chain element, `O(n²)` dyadic operations per queried point (the full-length
chain has `n + 1` elements of degrees `n, n−1, …`). The chain is hoisted
through `prep`, so the timed body is exactly the per-point evaluation. On the
registered schedule the chain coefficients (`O(n·h)` bits, ≤ ~60 GMP words at
the ceiling) keep each dyadic operation in the flat allocation-dominated cost
band, so wall clock tracks the `O(n²)` operation count; the ceiling is where
per-operation word cost starts to add a visible factor. -/

    signalFloorMultiplier := 1.0
  }

/- `mobiusTransform`. SPEC §"Complexity contract": `O(n²)` integer operations
per node (Taylor-shift pipeline, no rational arithmetic). The Taylor shifts
produce binomial-scaled coefficients of `Θ(n)` bits, but on the registered
schedule those operands stay within ~35 GMP words, where per-operation cost is
allocation-dominated and flat, so wall clock tracks the `O(n²)` operation
count. Below the floor the boxed-scalar-to-mpz transition inflates the local
slope (the reason the floor sits at 64); far past the ceiling the word count
would add its linear factor. -/

  }

/- `rootBound`. SPEC §"Complexity contract": `O(n·h)` integer operations. The
bounded-coefficient dense fixture holds `h` roughly constant, so the model
reduces to the linear coefficient scan `O(n)`. The floor sits at 64 because the
sub-microsecond per-call times below it are dominated by the fixed call
overhead, which deflates the fitted slope. -/

coefficient bit-length. -/
