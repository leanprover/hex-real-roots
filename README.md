# hex-real-roots

Part of [`hex`](https://github.com/kim-em/hex-dev), a computer algebra library
for Lean 4. The aim is fast executable code, fully verified, built with
spec-driven development.

Certified real-root isolation for dense integer polynomials, built on
[`hex-poly-z`](https://github.com/leanprover/hex-poly-z) without Mathlib. Each
half-open dyadic interval carries an exact Sturm-count witness; the
[`hex-real-roots-mathlib`](https://github.com/leanprover/hex-real-roots-mathlib)
companion proves the semantic isolation guarantees and provides `isolate_roots`.

# Quickstart

```toml
[[require]]
name = "hex-real-roots"
git = "https://github.com/leanprover/hex-real-roots.git"
rev = "main"
```

```lean
import HexRealRoots

open Hex

def p : ZPoly := DensePoly.ofCoeffs #[-2, 0, 0, 0, 1]

#eval (ZPoly.isolateRealRoots? p).map (fun roots => roots.isolations.size)
```

# Functionality

- `Hex.ZPoly.isolateRealRoots?` tries the Descartes search first and falls back to Sturm.
- `Hex.ZPoly.isolateSturm?` runs direct Sturm bisection.
- `Hex.ZPoly.isolateDescartes?` runs only the Descartes search, while still
  certifying every emitted interval with Sturm.
- `Hex.ZPoly.rootCount` computes the exact total real-root count.
- `Hex.ZPoly.sturmCount` computes the exact count in one half-open interval.
- `Hex.ZPoly.tarskiQuery` computes the signed variation drop for `(p, f*p')`
  on an open dyadic interval, with nonzero, squarefree and endpoint guards.
- `Hex.IntTarskiCertificate.certify` retains the literal signed-remainder certificate;
  `check` checks its identities, signs, degree bounds and input bindings.

The query uses the shared `SignedRemainderChain` kernel, also available with generic
endpoint sign operations and noncanonical coefficient representations. Produced-chain
and certificate acceptance and exact semantic domain equivalence are proved in
the companion. The Sturm–Tarski root-sum theorem is proved in the monorepo’s
development adapters, outside the published package. Its publication and the
remaining query performance evidence are specified in the SPEC.

`TarskiCertificate.Domain.replay?` validates supplied endpoint and squarefree
chain evidence once. `checkHit` reuses that evidence after exact context,
head, interval and witness bindings; it rejects cache misses. `checkCached` is
the complete checker and falls back to full replay on a literal mismatch.
`checkCached_eq` proves identical Boolean results to the
full checker for every certificate and cache, including invalid certificates.
These are finite replay guarantees, independent of the root-sum theorem.

`HexRealRoots.SignOperands` exposes conservative finite coefficient-sign
inventories for chain and Tarski replay. `SignedRemainderChain.signOperands`
and `TarskiCertificate.signOperands` retain every result dependency, including
unused supplied scales and an extra zero operand. Their `check_sign_congr`
theorems preserve exact Boolean results under agreement on the listed signs,
including rejection of malformed certificates. The Tarski theorem uses
`EndpointSigns.ofSign`, with endpoints in the coefficient domain; finite
endpoints contribute differences/evaluations and infinite endpoints contribute
leading coefficients. `Endpoint` also exposes the corresponding sign, order
and nonvanishing congruences. These are finite replay facts, independent of
root-sum semantics or a sign-cache law outside its keys.

`ZPoly.isolateRealRoots?` rejects the zero polynomial and, at the core level, expects a
squarefree positive-degree input. Nonzero constants produce an empty result.
The Mathlib bridge's `isolate_roots` elaborator automatically passes through
the squarefree core, so end users normally do not manage repeated roots
themselves.

# Verification

Descartes' rule of signs gives a fast search heuristic. Sturm counts provide
the trust boundary and the total fallback. Every candidate interval—regardless
of which engine found it—is accepted only after an exact Sturm check, and the
final array is checked against the exact total count. Descartes contributes
speed, not trust.

All endpoint evaluation is exact dyadic Horner arithmetic. There are no floats,
numerical tolerances, or interval-arithmetic assumptions in the certificate.

# Contributing

Development happens in the
[`hex-dev`](https://github.com/kim-em/hex-dev) monorepo, not in this published
mirror. Contributions are welcome as pull requests to the `SPEC/` directory:
describe the behavior you want and leave the implementation to the maintainer.
