JSONL emit driver for the `hex-real-roots` oracle.

`lake exe hexrealroots_emit_fixtures` writes one `poly` fixture record
per input polynomial followed by `result` records carrying Lean's
computed answer for each operation.  The companion driver
`scripts/oracle/realroots_flint.py` reads the same stream and
re-derives the real roots through python-flint's `fmpz_poly`
(`complex_roots` for the certified isolating balls, `factor` for the
exact rational roots), never by re-running the Lean isolator.

Operations covered:

* `root_count`   — `Hex.rootCount p`, the total number of real roots,
  value an `Int`.
* `isolations`   — the isolating intervals from `Hex.isolate? p`,
  value a matrix of rows `[lo_num, lo_exp, hi_num, hi_exp]`.  Each
  dyadic endpoint is encoded as `[num, exp]` with value `num · 2^(−exp)`
  (`Dyadic.zero` as `[0, 0]`, `Dyadic.ofOdd n k _` as `[n, k]`).
* `isolate_none` — value `true` for the rejection cases (the zero
  polynomial and non-square-free inputs), where the driver declines.

Records are emitted from the single top-level driver `Hex.isolate? p`.
The Descartes/Sturm cross-engine agreement check this driver once
carried (the executable stand-in for the termination theorem) is
retired now that `HexRealRootsMathlib.isolateDescartes?_isSome` is
proven; `isolate?` is Descartes-first, so on a square-free input its
output is exactly the Descartes engine's, and the emitted stream is
unchanged.

**ci tier.**  Thirty degree-15 polynomials with coefficients in
`[−9, 9]` drawn from the POSIX `rand` LCG
(`xₙ₊₁ = (1103515245·xₙ + 12345) mod 2^31`) folded into `[−9, 9]` by
`raw ↦ (raw mod 19) − 9`.  Candidate `i` takes coefficient `j` from the
`(i·16 + j + 1)`-th LCG state after the fixed seed.  A candidate is
accepted iff its degree-15 (leading) coefficient is nonzero *and* it is
`SquareFreeRat`; rejected candidates are skipped deterministically, and
the first thirty accepted candidates form the ci tier.  Only square-free
inputs receive isolation results, per the oracle-discipline rule that
non-square-free inputs are rejection cases.
