The `HexRealRoots` library certifies the isolation of the real roots of
integer-coefficient polynomials. A real root isolation is a half-open
dyadic interval `(lower, upper]` together with a witness, dischargeable
by `decide`, that exactly one real root of `p ∈ ℤ[x]` lies in it. The
witness is a Sturm count: the sign-variation difference of the Sturm
chain of `p` evaluated at the two endpoints, which counts the roots in
the interval exactly.

Isolation runs two engines over the same output type — a fast Descartes
search and a provably terminating Sturm search — and every emitted
isolation carries a Sturm-count witness regardless of which engine found
it. `ZPoly` values are evaluated at dyadic points by exact Horner
arithmetic, so the sign of `p(x)` at a dyadic `x` is exact: no floats,
no interval arithmetic, no error budget.

This is the Mathlib-free computational layer; the correctness and
completeness theorems live in the companion `HexRealRootsMathlib`.
