/-!
The top-level real-root isolation driver.

`isolate?` runs the two engines over the same output type: the fast
Descartes search first, falling back to the provably terminating Sturm
search on its `none`. Both emit `RealRootIsolations p` — pairwise-disjoint,
ordered, Sturm-count-certified isolations, one per real root — so the driver
is a one-liner that keeps whichever engine's certified output arrives first.

The companion `HexRealRootsMathlib` proves `isolate? p ≠ none` for squarefree
`p` (`isolate?_isSome`), routed through the Sturm engine's completeness
(`isolateSturm?_isSome`); the Descartes engine's own completeness waits on the
unformalised two-circle theorem and no driver-level fact depends on it.
Downstream libraries that need a total function (hex-rcf) combine `isolate?`
with `isolate?_isSome`.

/-- Isolate the real roots of `p ∈ ℤ[x]`: try the fast Descartes engine, fall
back to the Sturm engine on its `none`. Both engines produce the same
certified `RealRootIsolations p`, so the result carries a full Sturm-count
witness regardless of which one found it. Returns `none` only when both
engines decline (e.g. non-squarefree input); the companion proves this never
happens for squarefree `p`. -/
def isolate? (p : ZPoly) : Option (RealRootIsolations p) :=
  isolateDescartes? p <|> isolateSturm? p

/-! Sanity checks (kept light; conformance lives in the shared sub-project).
Polynomials are kept tiny so kernel reduction of `isolate?` is fast; the
higher-degree fixtures live in the `#eval`-driven conformance suite. -/

-- The zero polynomial and constants classify as `none`/isolations-of-a-root
-- exactly as the engines do: `isolate?` inherits each engine's contract.
example : isolate? (DensePoly.ofCoeffs (#[] : Array Int)) = none := by decide
example : (isolate? (DensePoly.ofCoeffs #[(7 : Int)])).isSome = true := by decide

-- The positive-degree fixtures route through the Descartes engine's rational
-- squarefree decision, which the kernel does not reduce across the module
-- boundary (it goes through `ceilSqrt`), so they are exercised by `#eval` in
-- the conformance suite rather than `decide` here. Representative results:
--   `isolate? (x − 5)`        ⇒ `some`, 1 isolation
--   `isolate? (x² − 1)`       ⇒ `some`, 2 isolations
--   `isolate? (x² + 1)`       ⇒ `some`, 0 isolations
--   `isolate? ((x−1)²(x+1))`  ⇒ `none` (not squarefree; both engines decline)
