Executable chain-validity certificate for kernel replay.

The `isolate_roots` term elaborator (companion `HexRealRootsMathlib`) reifies
the Sturm chain of `p` once as a literal `Array ZPoly`, then discharges every
per-interval `count_one` and the `complete` field as cheap sign-variation
`decide`s against that literal chain, rather than rebuilding `sturmChain p`
inside each field. `SturmChainCert p chain` is the single decidable predicate
that validates the reified chain: it verifies, by coefficient-level checks that
kernel-reduce, that `chain` *is* the Sturm chain of `p`. Its soundness bridge
`cert_imp_eq` proves `chain = sturmChain p` as a proposition (the ban is only on
*deciding* an `Array ZPoly` equality in the kernel — because
`Array.instDecidableEqImpl` is not exposed by the module system — not on proving
one), whence the two
transport lemmas `sturmCount_eq_of_cert` / `rootCount_eq_of_cert` rewrite the
certified counts onto the literal chain.

`orderedAdjacent` and `ordered_of_adjacent` are the companion upgrade for the
`RealRootIsolations.ordered` field: an engine emits its isolations sorted, so
the elaborator checks only the `size − 1` adjacent-pair inequalities (an `O(n)`
`decide`) and this lemma walks them up to the all-pairs `ordered` shape by
transitivity.

Everything here is Mathlib-free: coefficient extensionality, structural
induction over the chain, and the core `Dyadic` order lemmas.

/-- Coefficient-level Boolean equality for `ZPoly`: the generic
`DensePoly.beqCoeffs` at `R = Int`. Kept as an `abbrev` so the Sturm-chain
checkers below read at the `ZPoly` level; see `DensePoly.beqCoeffs` for why
this is used instead of the structural `DecidableEq`. -/

/-- The tail validator for `SturmChainCert`: given the two most recent chain
elements `prev`, `cur`, check that `rest` continues the Sturm chain exactly as
`sturmChainAux` builds it. An empty tail requires the next pseudo-remainder to
vanish (`sturmChainAux`'s stopping condition); a nonempty tail requires the
pseudo-remainder nonzero, its next element `= −primitivePart (spem prev cur)`,
and the rest to continue from `cur`, `next`. Mirrors `sturmChainAux`'s branch
structure so `certTail_sound` is a direct induction. -/

/-- A decidable executable certificate that `chain` is the Sturm chain of `p`,
by coefficient-level checks that kernel-reduce.

`chain` must have at least two elements, `p` must have positive degree
(`2 ≤ p.size`) and `chain` must be no longer than `p.size` (a fuel bound that
every genuine chain satisfies, since chain degrees strictly decrease). The head
must be `primitivePart p`, the second `primitivePart p'`, each further element
`−primitivePart (spem …)` of its two predecessors, and the chain must terminate
with a vanishing pseudo-remainder — exactly `sturmChain`'s construction. All
element comparisons go through `beqCoeffs`, never structural `Array` equality. -/
