# hex-real-roots (real root isolation, depends on hex-poly-z)

Certified isolation of the real roots of integer-coefficient
polynomials. A real root isolation is a half-open dyadic interval
`(lower, upper]` together with a witness, dischargeable by `decide`,
that exactly one real root of `p ∈ ℤ[x]` lies in the interval. The
witness is a **Sturm count**: the sign-variation difference of the
Sturm chain of `p` evaluated at the two endpoints, which counts the
roots in the interval exactly.

Isolation runs two engines over the same output type:

- a **Descartes search** (Collins-Akritas bisection: Descartes' rule
  of signs applied to Möbius transforms of `p`), which is fast but
  whose termination bound is not certified here, and
- a **Sturm search** (bisection on exact Sturm counts), which is
  slower per node but provably terminates at a computable depth.

Every emitted isolation carries a Sturm-count witness regardless of
which engine found it, and every full output is checked against the
exact total root count. The Descartes engine therefore contributes
speed and no trust. The correctness and completeness theorems in
[hex-real-roots-mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover/hex-real-roots-mathlib) rest on Sturm
counts alone.

The companion library to [hex-roots](https://github.com/leanprover/hex-roots) (complex root
isolation): the same conventions for dyadic data, exact witness
arithmetic, fueled `Option`-valued drivers, and the
quotient-by-overlap identity of a root.

## Exact witness arithmetic

A `ZPoly` evaluated at a dyadic point by Horner's rule yields an
exact `Dyadic` value, so the sign of `p(x)` at dyadic `x` is exact.
Every witness is an equality or comparison between integer counts,
and is `Decidable`: no floats, no interval arithmetic, no error
budget. The one rational computation in the library is hex-poly-z's
`SquareFreeRat` test in the drivers; witnesses never contain
rational data.

**Compiled integer sign.** `HexRealRoots.Sign`, publicly imported by `Basic`,
provides `Hex.Int.signImpl` using comparisons with zero. The ordinary-kernel
function equality `Hex.Int.sign_eq_signImpl` registers a global `@[csimp]`
replacement for `Int.sign` in subsequently compiled importing modules. The
logical `Int.sign` and all witness/correspondence statements remain unchanged.
This avoids copying positive multiprecision magnitudes in the pinned toolchain;
it does not replace generic supplied sign oracles or claim an end-to-end bound.

**Sign variations.** For a list of exact values, `signVar` counts the
sign changes of the nonzero entries, skipping zeros: the variation
count of `(+, 0, −)` is 1. All variation counts below use this
zero-skipping convention.

## The Sturm chain

```lean
namespace Hex

/-- The Sturm chain of `p`: `s₀ = primitivePart p`,
    `s₁ = primitivePart p'`, and
    `s_{i+1} = −primitivePart (spem s_{i−1} s_i)` while the remainder
    is nonzero, where `spem` is the pseudo-remainder with its
    multiplier forced positive. Each element is a positive rational
    multiple of the classical signed-remainder chain of `(p, p')`
    over `ℚ`, which is the invariant the counting theorem needs. -/
def sturmChain (p : ZPoly) : Array ZPoly
```

The sign-managed pseudo-remainder `spem f g` computes the standard
pseudo-remainder `prem f g = (lc g)^δ · f mod g` with
`δ = deg f − deg g + 1`, then negates the result when `(lc g)^δ < 0`.
The output is a positive integer multiple of the rational remainder
`f mod g`, so dividing by the (positive) content and negating gives
the next chain element with the correct sign. Coefficients stay in
`ℤ` throughout, and the content division keeps them as small as any
pseudo-remainder scheme allows.

The last chain element is a nonzero constant exactly when `p` is
squarefree (of positive degree).

`hasSquarefreeSturmChain p` reads off exactly this: `true` when `p` has
positive degree and the last chain element is a nonzero constant. It is a
reducible executable `Bool`, so a caller discharges the drivers'
`SquareFreeRat p` obligation by `by decide` on the chain rather than the
rational gcd (soundness bridge `squareFreeRat_of_hasSquarefreeSturmChain`
in the companion). One-way: `false` on the zero polynomial and nonzero
constants.

**Input contract.** The drivers do not take hypotheses; they classify
every input explicitly:

- `p = 0`: `none`. (`SquareFreeRat 0` holds vacuously through the
  gcd size test, so the drivers check `p ≠ 0` separately.)
- `p` a nonzero constant: `some` with an empty isolation array,
  matching `ZPoly.rootCount p = 0`.
- `p` of positive degree, not `SquareFreeRat`: `none`. Callers use
  `Hex.ZPoly.squareFreeCore` first.
- `p` of positive degree and squarefree: complete isolation.

`sturmChain`, `rootBound`, `sepPrec`, and `isolationDepth` are total
functions. For `deg p ≤ 0` they return the empty chain, `1`, `0`,
and `depthSlack` respectively, and no theorem reads those values.

## Rational Sturm evaluation

The point-comparison consumer also needs exact rational endpoints:

```lean
def sturmVarAtRat (chain : Array ZPoly) (x : Rat) : Nat
def ZPoly.sturmCountRat (p : ZPoly) (lower upper : Rat) : Int
```

For `x=u/v`, `v>0`, compute the sign of each entry `s` by homogeneous
integer Horner evaluation of `v^deg(s) * s(u/v)`, then count nonzero sign
variations. Positive denominator powers preserve signs, including exact zero.
`sturmCountRat` is the variation difference of the derivative chain at its
two rational endpoints. It is total; the root-count theorem requires nonzero
squarefree `p` and `lower < upper`, with the same half-open convention as the
dyadic count. A root at `upper` is included and one at `lower` is excluded.

Require companion `sturmVarAtRat_eq` identifying the result with real
polynomial evaluation, `sturmVarAtRat_dyadic` for agreement at `x.toRat`, and
`sturmCountRat_eq` for the root count in `(lower,upper]`. Point comparison
builds one shared chain and uses its two variation evaluations directly;
it need not rebuild a chain for each endpoint. Each evaluation takes one
finite Horner walk per chain entry, with at most `deg p + 1` entries for a
derivative chain. Computing denominator powers is bounded exponentiation in
the entry degrees. This adds no refinement, isolation or factorization.
Test non-dyadic rational endpoints, exact roots, and agreement with the
dyadic counts. These primitives belong here, not in the number-field layer.

## Tarski queries

The query and replay declarations are implemented in `SignedRemainderChain.lean` and
`Tarski.lean`, with array-loop replay invariants in `TarskiProofs.lean`.
The ordered-domain kernel is shared with the
[ordered-field frontend](../../SPEC/Libraries/hex-sturm.md). The companion
proves algebraic correspondence, produced-certificate acceptance and exact
semantic domain equivalence. The root-sum theorem is proved in the development
`HexQuerySemantics` adapters. Publication of that semantic layer and the
remaining Phase-4 evidence are still required.

Preserve the following public integer/dyadic frontend for the
[fixed-field sign consumer](../../HexNumberField/SPEC/hex-number-field.md#fixed-field-sign):

```lean
def ZPoly.tarskiQuery (p f : ZPoly) (I : DyadicInterval) : Option Int
```

For nonzero squarefree `p` with neither endpoint a root of `p`, return

```text
some (∑ α : real roots of p in (I.lower,I.upper), sign (f(α))).
```

The open and half-open sums coincide under the endpoint guard. A nonzero
constant `p` returns `some 0`; `p=0`, nonsquarefree positive-degree `p`, or
an endpoint root returns `none`, not a misleading root count. Check `p` and
endpoints before the `f=0` shortcut, which then returns `some 0`. Arbitrary
`f`, including common factors with `p`, is supported. The fixed-field wrapper
constructs a root-free interval directly from its refined complex square;
an arbitrary `RealRootIsolation` alone need not have root-free endpoints.
Its count-one witness does not remove this guard. Ordinary point comparison
continues to use the half-open derivative Sturm count and therefore handles
a rational point exactly equal to a root without calling this query on a
root endpoint.

Compute the Sturm–Tarski variation drop for `(p, f*p')` with exact integer
arithmetic. First reduce `f*p'` modulo `p` over `ℚ`, using positive-scaled
pseudo-division to keep integer coefficients. A positive scaling of the
remainder is sufficient. This reduces the degree of the second entry below
`deg p`; retaining an arbitrary unreduced `f*p'` would violate the descending
chain invariant. A zero remainder gives the singleton chain `[p]` and query
zero. Otherwise use negative pseudo-remainders with positive multipliers,
divide out only positive content, and stop at the last nonzero remainder.
The last entry may be a nonconstant gcd. Preserve signs: independently making
every chain entry positive-leading would change the query.

Evaluate the chain at both dyadic endpoints, skip zero entries in each sign
list, and subtract variations in `Int`. Negative answers are valid; this is
a signed sum rather than a nonnegative root count. There is no isolation,
refinement, factorization or floating-point operation inside `tarskiQuery`.
After the initial reduction there are at most `deg p + 1` nonzero entries,
and at most `deg p` Euclidean remainder steps including termination. The
initial pseudo-division takes
zero leading-term cancellations if `f*p'=0` or `deg(f*p') < deg p`, and
at most `deg(f*p') - deg p + 1` otherwise; each subsequent division has
the same conditional degree-difference bound. Polynomial products and exact Horner
folds have their array-length bounds. With classical dense arithmetic a
conservative bound is `O((deg f + 1)*deg p + (deg p)^3)` integer-ring
operations, excluding the separately bounded squarefreeness check; this is
not a unit-cost bit bound on growing coefficients. Phase 4 measures their
bit lengths as well as degrees.

The integer implementation and the operation-only generic interface use the
same owned primitive. The integer backend removes positive content; the
identity normalizer is available for exact field and representation backends.
Squarefree guards on representation coefficients test a semantically nonzero
constant gcd, or a Bézout identity by zero differences. Monicization does not
make structural equality to `1` a valid semantic guard. The explicit total
sign and natural-cast interface is the shared execution contract. Literal
context/operand checks remain exact binding checks, separate from these
semantic polynomial equations.


### Shared ordered-domain kernel

Generalize the signed-remainder/query-replay primitive here, below the family,
over an ordinary executable ordered commutative domain `D`. Use existing
`DensePoly D`, total ring operations, decidable equality/order and
[ordered-domain pseudo-division](../../HexPoly/SPEC/hex-poly.md#ordered-domain-pseudo-division).
The domain need not be a field: integers are an actual instance. The same
operation-only kernel accepts canonical-zero representation coefficients under
the [execution contract](../../SPEC/real-closure-execution.md); the companion
proves their interpretation in the ordered domain. No field instance is
asserted on raw representatives. Bounded sign attempts cannot supply its
total sign. Replay identities use semantic zero differences.

This owner provides `Endpoint E := negInf | finite E | posInf`, the chain
producer, zero-skipping variation fold and literal replay. `EndpointSigns` supplies total finite comparison and exact evaluation signs, with
correctness proved once. It may interpret endpoints in an ordered extension
of `D`: `E=Dyadic` need not be an integer when `D=Int`. This is an endpoint
interface, not an evidence-returning coefficient-arithmetic framework.
Infinity signs use leading coefficient and degree parity.

`SignedRemainderChain.map` and `TarskiCertificate.map` transport supplied literal
evidence through zero-reflecting coefficient maps. Preservation of scalar
operations, natural casts, coefficient signs, endpoint comparison and evaluation
signs proves checker acceptance after transport. The context and value are
retained exactly; polynomial and endpoint bindings are mapped explicitly.
This does not require injectivity, field instances on stored representatives,
or rerunning the producer.

The producer uses the positive-scaled initial reduction, three-term
recurrence and terminal zero identity specified below, including singleton
and constant branches. The head is the input `p`. Removing positive content
from a head or later entry records the corresponding positive scale.
Primitive and signed subresultant backends obey the same recurrence and
prove equality of query values; negative subresultant factors require sign
correction of entries and identities, not merely absolute values.

Every later nonzero degree strictly decreases. Computation terminates by
these degree bounds, with no caller threshold. Finite scans and replay
terminate by input size. No coefficient operation accepts or returns a
resource budget, and there is no second raw-array degree or gcd API.
The query value is the `Int` variation drop.

The frontend supplies the mathematical domain: nonzero `p`, squarefree over
the fraction field of `D`, strictly ordered endpoints and no finite endpoint
roots. Check guards before zero-query or constant shortcuts. Integer `4*X`
is admissible; content does not create repeated roots. The public integer
frontend retains `Option Int`, with `none` exactly on invalid mathematical
input. A false certificate check means the proposed evidence is incorrect,
not that the query lacks a value.

The shared `Hex.TarskiCertificate.check` verifies the literal identities,
degrees, signs and guard witnesses. `HexRealRootsMathlib.Tarski.check_rootSum` is owned by
[hex-real-roots-mathlib](../../HexRealRootsMathlib/SPEC/hex-real-roots-mathlib.md#representation-and-replay-bridge).
For ordinary exact coefficients these checks use total equality/order.
For expensive extension comparisons, the tactic proof interface may instead
supply kernel proofs or finite verified sign certificates for the precise
coefficient claims; it does not regenerate the chain, isolate roots or
restart coefficient refinement. Arithmetic correctness theorems justify
operations without a certificate attached to every addition or product.

`ZPoly.tarskiQuery` instantiates this kernel with exact integer arithmetic,
positive content normalization and exact dyadic Horner signs. The generic
field frontend invokes the same initial reduction and recurrence. Prove
backend equality and certificate translation for the optimized integer
operations. Positive denominator clearing of rational `p,f` separately
preserves the entire `Option` and transports replay as specified in
hex-sturm. No upstream module imports hex-sturm for these generic helpers.

Keep existing derivative `sturmChain`, half-open `sturmCount`, RCF replay
and `Polynomial ℝ` proofs intact. The shared abstract soundness theorem and
integer specialization are owned by hex-real-roots-mathlib; field frontend
correspondence is owned by hex-sturm-mathlib. These proved semantic modules
currently live under `adapters/` in the development-only `HexQuerySemantics`
target, outside the published libraries. Publishing the layer requires the
companion managed paths and Tau Ceti release pins specified by the companion
SPEC. BKR matrices remain downstream.

### Literal query certificates

Provide a Mathlib-free `IntTarskiCertificate` and Boolean `check p f I value` alongside
the driver, with companion theorem `IntTarskiCertificate.check_sound`. Reuse the
positive three-term recurrence design of
[RCF Sturm replay](../../HexRCF/SturmCheck.lean), not its derivative-specific
acceptance predicate. The certificate contains:

- A literal chain with head `p`, positive scaling data for the initial
  reduction `u*(f*p') = A*p + v*s₁` (`u,v>0`), and `deg s₁ < deg p`.
  For a singleton chain check the same identity with zero remainder.
- Positive-scaled identities `l*sᵢ = Q*sᵢ₊₁ - r*sᵢ₊₂` for each triple,
  nonzero entries and strictly descending degrees. The final division has
  zero remainder, checked by `l*sᵢ = Q*sᵢ₊₁` with `l>0`; do not demand a
  constant last entry. The quotient is literal certificate data.
- The nonzero/squarefree input check (or a separately checked derivative-chain
  certificate), non-root endpoint tests, and exact endpoint evaluation/sign
  data whose recomputed variation difference equals the claimed integer.

The checker walks bounded literal arrays and checks multiplication identities;
it does not search for chains or roots in the kernel. Bound accepted chain
length by `deg p + 1`; degree checks reject oversized chains. Singleton,
constant-head and zero-query cases have explicit branches with the same domain
guards. Reject wrong initial products, negative scales, missing terminal
identities, and incorrect endpoint signs.

The current RCF `SturmReplay.check` enforces `p' = derivScale*s₁`, strict degree
descent and a terminal nonzero constant. Common-root packages replay the gcd's
own derivative chain. Consequently it does not check a general Tarski query.
Its soundness theorem yields `Sturm.IsSturmChain`, whose root-flank orientation
and constant-tail conditions cannot describe negative or zero contributions.
The signed-remainder/Cauchy-index theorem is proved in the development adapters of
[hex-real-roots-mathlib](../../HexRealRootsMathlib/SPEC/hex-real-roots-mathlib.md#sturm-tarski-correspondence),
including arbitrary common gcd and zero remainder; it is not a corollary
of the root-count theorem. Keep the current RCF checker intact;
shared recurrence helpers can move downward without creating an import cycle.

Require `tarskiQuery_eq` for the displayed signed sum and `tarskiQuery_isSome`
for exactly the guarded domain. When `I` contains one root `α`, derive
`tarskiQuery_sign`, equating the query to `sign (f(α))`. In the number-field
companion this composes into `signTarski_eq` against `realCompare`; the
root library itself never imports algebraic-number semantics. The theorem
and the literal checker are required delivery, while a user-facing comparison
elaborator is deferred under the consumer's certificate policy.

Conformance covers queries `-1,0,1`, several roots with cancelling signs,
`f=0`, `f` divisible by `p`, a proper common factor, degree `f ≥ deg p`,
constant/zero/nonsquarefree `p`, and endpoint-root rejection. Generate expected
signed sums from python-flint's exact selected roots and signs. Benchmark chain
construction separately from endpoint evaluation under the
[consumer's comparison evidence contract](../../SPEC/Libraries/hex-real-algebraic.md#comparison-conformance-and-phase-4-evidence).

## Sturm counts

```lean
/-- Zero-skipping sign variations of the chain evaluated at a dyadic
    point. Exact Horner evaluation of every chain element. -/
def sturmVarAt (chain : Array ZPoly) (x : Dyadic) : Nat

/-- Variations at −∞ and +∞, read off the leading coefficients and
    the degree parities. No evaluation. -/
def sturmVarNegInf (chain : Array ZPoly) : Nat
def sturmVarPosInf (chain : Array ZPoly) : Nat

/-- The number of real roots of `p` in `(I.lower, I.upper]`, as
    certified by the Sturm chain. An `Int` by definition. The
    companion proves it equals the root count (in particular, that it
    is nonnegative) for squarefree `p`. -/
def ZPoly.sturmCount (p : ZPoly) (I : DyadicInterval) : Int :=
  sturmVarAt (sturmChain p) I.lower − sturmVarAt (sturmChain p) I.upper

/-- The total number of real roots of `p`. -/
def ZPoly.rootCount (p : ZPoly) : Nat :=
  sturmVarNegInf (sturmChain p) − sturmVarPosInf (sturmChain p)
```

The zero-skipping convention makes the count match the half-open
interval exactly: a root at `upper` is counted (the variation between
`s₀` and `s₁` that exists just left of the root disappears at it),
and a root at `lower` is not. This is why isolations are half-open on
the left: interval arithmetic, bisection, and counting all agree on
`(lower, upper]` with no endpoint case analysis in the drivers.

The drivers compute the chain once per polynomial and memoise
`sturmVarAt` per endpoint, and bisection reuses each endpoint's
variation count in both child intervals.

## Contents

```lean
structure DyadicInterval where
  lower : Dyadic
  upper : Dyadic
  lt    : lower < upper

/-- Exactly one real root of `p` lies in `(interval.lower,
    interval.upper]`. -/
structure RealRootIsolation (p : ZPoly) where
  interval  : DyadicInterval
  count_one : ZPoly.sturmCount p interval = 1

/-- A complete isolation run: pairwise-disjoint isolations, in
    increasing order, one per real root of `p`. Both invariants are
    decidable data, so for squarefree `p` the structure certifies
    itself no matter which engine produced it. -/
structure RealRootIsolations (p : ZPoly) where
  isolations : Array (RealRootIsolation p)
  ordered    : ∀ i j : Fin isolations.size, i < j →
                 isolations[i].interval.upper ≤
                   isolations[j].interval.lower
  complete   : isolations.size = ZPoly.rootCount p

end Hex
```

`ordered` gives pairwise disjointness for free: half-open intervals
that touch at an endpoint are still disjoint as sets. `complete` is
the completeness certificate: `count_one` puts exactly one root in
each interval, the intervals are disjoint, and there are exactly
`ZPoly.rootCount p` of them, so every real root is captured. The companion
turns these three decidable facts, under `SquareFreeRat p`, into the
semantic statement. No theorem about either search engine is
involved.

## Bounds and depths

```lean
/-- A power of two strictly exceeding the Cauchy root bound
    `1 + max |a_i| / |a_n|`. All real roots lie in
    `(−rootBound p, rootBound p]`. Integer arithmetic only. -/
def rootBound (p : ZPoly) : Dyadic

/-- Separation precision: for any two distinct complex roots
    `z₁ ≠ z₂` of `p`, `2^{−sepPrec p} < ‖z₁ − z₂‖ / 4`. The contract
    is pairwise, so it is vacuous when `p` has fewer than two roots
    (degree ≤ 1), which is exactly when nothing needs it. Closed-form
    integer arithmetic from the Mahler bound, using `|disc p| ≥ 1`
    for squarefree `p` and Landau's inequality, never the
    discriminant value itself. The same closed form as hex-roots'
    `mahlerPrec`. -/
def sepPrec (p : ZPoly) : Nat

/-- The bisection depth at which both engines stop: enough halvings
    to take the initial interval `(−rootBound p, rootBound p]` to
    width below `2^{−sepPrec p}`, plus a fixed slack. -/
def isolationDepth (p : ZPoly) : Nat :=
  sepPrec p + ceilLog2Dyadic (2 * rootBound p) + depthSlack
```

with `depthSlack := 8`. `sepPrec` bounds the distance between *all*
pairs of distinct complex roots, which serves both engines: the Sturm
engine's termination proof needs the bound only for real pairs, and
the Descartes engine's classical termination analysis needs the
complex pairs too (see "Termination" below). The depth is a stopping bound, not a refinement target, so
`depthSlack` can be generous at almost no cost: both engines stop
subdividing an interval the moment its count resolves.

## The Sturm engine

```lean
def ZPoly.isolateSturm? (p : ZPoly) : Option (RealRootIsolations p)
```

Worklist bisection from `(−rootBound p, rootBound p]`. For each
interval, compute the Sturm count:

- count `0`: discard;
- count `1`: emit (the count is the witness, via `if h : _`);
- count `≥ 2`: bisect at the dyadic midpoint, unless the interval has
  reached `isolationDepth p`, in which case return `none`.

After the worklist drains, assemble the emitted isolations in
increasing order and check `complete` (via `if h : _`). A failed
check also returns `none`. A `none` from this engine has one precise
meaning: an interval at separation depth still reported two or more
roots, or the totals disagreed. The companion proves both impossible
for squarefree input, so `ZPoly.isolateSturm?` is total in the sense that
matters. The `Option` is the same fuel discipline as hex-roots'
drivers.

## The Descartes engine

```lean
/-- The integer Möbius transform of `p` relative to `(a, b]`: the
    numerator of `(1 + x)^{deg p} · p((a + bx)/(1 + x))` after
    clearing the dyadic denominators (a positive power of two). Its
    positive real roots correspond bijectively, with multiplicity, to
    the real roots of `p` in the open interval `(a, b)`. -/
def mobiusTransform (p : ZPoly) (I : DyadicInterval) : ZPoly

/-- Sign variations of the coefficient list. -/
def descartesVar (p : ZPoly) : Nat

def ZPoly.isolateDescartes? (p : ZPoly) : Option (RealRootIsolations p)
```

The search runs the same worklist, dispatching on
`V := descartesVar (mobiusTransform p I)` and the exact test
`p(b) = 0`:

| `V` | `p(b) = 0` | action                        |
|-----|------------|-------------------------------|
| 0   | no         | discard                       |
| 0   | yes        | candidate (root is `b` itself)|
| 1   | no         | candidate                     |
| 1   | yes        | bisect (two roots in `(a, b]`)|
| ≥ 2 | either     | bisect                        |

Descartes' rule makes the discard row sound (`V = 0` means no roots
in the open interval) and the candidate rows plausible, but the
engine trusts neither: every candidate is certified by computing its
Sturm count, and a candidate whose count is not `1` aborts the engine
with `none`. Bisection past `isolationDepth p` also returns `none`,
as does a failed final `complete` check. The classical analysis says
none of these happen (see "Termination"), but nothing here depends on
that: the Descartes engine is a search heuristic wrapped in Sturm
certificates, and it carries **no proof obligations** in the
companion beyond the deferred termination statement.

The per-node cost is one Möbius transform (`O(n²)` integer
operations via Taylor shift) against the Sturm engine's full chain
evaluation, which is why this engine runs first.

## The driver

```lean
def ZPoly.isolateRealRoots? (p : ZPoly) : Option (RealRootIsolations p) :=
  ZPoly.isolateDescartes? p <|> ZPoly.isolateSturm? p
```

The companion proves `ZPoly.isolateRealRoots? p ≠ none` for squarefree `p` (through
the Sturm engine). Downstream libraries that need a total function
(hex-rcf) obtain one by combining `ZPoly.isolateRealRoots?` with that theorem.

## Termination

Both engines terminate structurally: each worklist entry carries its
remaining depth budget, bisection decreases it, and no analytic input
is required. What the depth budget *suffices for* differs:

- **Sturm engine.** At depth `isolationDepth p` every interval has
  width below `2^{−sepPrec p} < sep(p)/4`, so it contains at most one
  real root, so its exact count is `0` or `1` and the worklist
  drains. This is a theorem of the companion
  (`isolateSturm?_isSome`).
- **Descartes engine.** The classical termination analysis (the
  Obreshkoff two-circle theorem; Krandick-Mehlhorn 2006) shows that
  once an interval's width is below a constant multiple of `sep(p)`
  (the minimum distance between distinct complex roots), its
  variation count is `0` or `1`, so `ZPoly.isolateDescartes? p ≠ none` for
  squarefree `p` at this depth. The mechanism is the *λ-graded* sector
  bound (not a general count bound — the reading "variation count ≤
  number of roots in the two-circle region" is false): at most `λ`
  roots outside the half-angle-`π/(λ+2)` sector force at most `λ` sign
  variations. A short interval's two-circle region is too small to hold
  two roots, and a lone non-real root there is excluded because the
  region is symmetric about the real axis (conjugate pairs), so the
  outside-sector count stays `≤ 1` and hence the variation count `≤ 1`.
  This is now a theorem of the companion
  (`isolateDescartes?_isSome`): it retires the Sturm fallback from the
  runtime story, though no other theorem depends on it and the driver's
  completeness never waited for it.

Note the separation quantity is over **complex** roots in both cases.
A real-gap bound is not enough for the Descartes engine: a conjugate
pair close to the real axis, as in `(x − 1)² + ε²`, keeps the
variation count at 2 on every interval around its real part until the
width shrinks to the order of `ε`, even though the polynomial has no
real roots at all.

## Refinement

```lean
namespace Hex.RealRootIsolation

/-- Bisect at the dyadic midpoint and keep the half whose Sturm count
    is 1: one chain evaluation at the midpoint decides. Returns the
    input unchanged in the (impossible for squarefree `p`, proven in
    the companion) case that neither half certifies. -/
def refine1 (iso : RealRootIsolation p) : RealRootIsolation p

/-- Iterate `refine1` until the interval width is at most
    `2^{−target}`. Fueled by the width gap; total. -/
def refineTo (iso : RealRootIsolation p) (target : Int) :
    RealRootIsolation p

end Hex.RealRootIsolation
```

Because the witness is a count, refinement has no endpoint case
analysis: a root exactly at the midpoint `m` lands in the left half
`(a, m]` by the half-open convention, and the counts say so. The
width-halving guarantee is the companion theorem
`refine1_isolates_same`, conditional on squarefree `p`. On data that
violates the isolation semantics the fallback branch returns the
input unchanged and `refineTo` stops when its fuel runs out; neither
function can loop.

`refine1` recomputes the Sturm chain on every bisection. For callers
that refine many levels in one go (the `isolate_roots` term
elaborator refining every root to a requested width), a cached-chain
variant threads one precomputed chain through the bisection loop;
same semantics, one chain construction total.

## Kernel-replay exposure

The `isolate_roots` term elaborator (companion SPEC) replays Sturm
certificates in the kernel. The replayed closure — fourteen

`sturmVarPosInf`, `ZPoly.sturmCount`, `ZPoly.rootCount`, `ZPoly.evalDyadic`,
`ZPoly.hornerDyadic`, `dyadicSign` — carries `@[expose]` so downstream `module` consumers
can `decide` against it without `import all`, and the three private
helpers (`spemStep`, `spemAux`, `sturmChainAux`) become public (an
exposed definition may not reference a `private` one). The whole closure is structural-fuel recursion; nothing in it
is well-founded, so exposure suffices for kernel reduction.

## `SimpleRealRoot`: identity of a root, up to isolation

```lean
namespace Hex

/-- An isolation refined to separation precision. At width below
    `sep(p)/4`, two refined isolations isolate the same root exactly
    when their intervals overlap. -/
def RefinedRealIsolation (p : ZPoly) :=
  {iso : RealRootIsolation p //
     iso.interval.upper − iso.interval.lower ≤ twoPow (−(sepPrec p : Int))}

/-- The half-open intervals intersect:
    `max lower₁ lower₂ < min upper₁ upper₂`. One dyadic comparison. -/
def Overlaps (i₁ i₂ : RefinedRealIsolation p) : Prop := …
instance : Decidable (Overlaps i₁ i₂) := …

/-- The identity of a real root, independent of which isolation
    witnessed it. -/
def SimpleRealRoot (p : ZPoly) := Quot (Overlaps (p := p))

def SimpleRealRoot.mk (iso : RefinedRealIsolation p) : SimpleRealRoot p :=
  Quot.mk _ iso

/-- Boolean form of `Overlaps`, used for equality tests on data
    containing roots. -/
def RefinedRealIsolation.sameRoot (i₁ i₂ : RefinedRealIsolation p) : Bool := …

/-- Refine an isolation to separation precision and package it as a
    `RefinedRealIsolation`: `refineTo (sepPrec p)`, then the width check.
    `none` only on data violating the isolation semantics (unreachable
    for squarefree `p`, per the companion's `refine1_isolates_same`).
    The entry point of the threading pattern: call once, thread the
    refined value forward. -/
def RealRootIsolation.refined (iso : RealRootIsolation p) :
    Option (RefinedRealIsolation p)

end Hex
```

Why the width bound is part of the type: without it, a coarse
isolation overlapping several fine ones would relate distinct roots
and the quotient would collapse them. With both widths below
`sep(p)/4`, two overlapping intervals contain points within
`sep(p)/2` of both roots, forcing the roots to coincide. Conversely,
two isolations of the same root both contain it, so they overlap.
That argument is semantic, so this library takes the quotient with
`Quot` (which needs no equivalence proof) and provides no
`DecidableEq (SimpleRealRoot p)`. The companion proves that
`Overlaps` restricted to `RefinedRealIsolation` is an equivalence
relation whose classes are exactly the real roots, and hence that
`sameRoot` decides equality in the quotient. Code in the Mathlib-free
layer compares roots with `sameRoot` directly.

The threading pattern for representatives is the same as in
hex-roots: refine once, pass the refined value forward, never
re-refine from a stored coarse representative. See
[hex-roots.md](../../HexRoots/SPEC/hex-roots.md) §"The threading pattern".

## Design choices not taken

- **A single engine.** Sturm alone is provably complete but pays a
  full chain evaluation per bisection node. Descartes alone is fast,
  but its termination proof needs the unformalised two-circle
  theorem. Running Descartes inside Sturm certificates takes the
  speed of one and the theorems of the other, at the cost of one
  extra (cheap) certification per emitted root.
- **The Sylvester-Habicht / subresultant chain.** Computing the chain
  through hex-resultant's subresultant sequence would avoid the
  content gcds, at the price of the sign-management bookkeeping and a
  dependency. The primitive chain's coefficients are already minimal
  among pseudo-remainder schemes, and the chain is computed once per
  polynomial, so the content gcds are not on the hot path.
- **Tighter root bounds (Akritas-Strzeboński's LMQ).** Mathlib
  already has `Polynomial.cauchyBound` with its root-bound theorem. A
  tighter start bound would save only the top few bisection levels
  and would add a fresh analytic proof obligation.
- **Vincent / continued-fraction search (VCA, VAS).** Faster than
  bisection in some regimes, but Vincent's theorem is formalised
  nowhere and the search does not change the certificate story.
- **Newton refinement.** Out of scope: `refine1` bisection is enough
  for the consumers in this repository. hex-roots' speculative Newton
  pattern would port if profiling ever demands it.

  `bench/HexRealRoots/Bench.lean`: the conformance and bench drivers,
  in the shared sub-projects.

## Conformance fixtures

Per [SPEC/testing.md](../../SPEC/testing.md), fixtures are tiered into
`core` / `ci` / `local`.

- *core* (Lean-only, runs on every push):
  - Linear: `x − 5`.
  - `x² − 1` (roots at `±1`), `x² + 1` (no real roots), `x³ − x`
    (roots at `−1, 0, 1`), `x³ − x − 1` (one real root).
  - Dyadic-root edge cases: `(2x − 1)(x − 2)` (a root that bisection
    midpoints hit exactly), `x(x − 1)` (adjacent isolations sharing
    an endpoint).
  - Chebyshev `T₅` (five roots in `[−1, 1]`), cyclotomic `Φ₅` (no
    real roots).
  - Non-squarefree rejection: `(x − 1)²(x + 1)` returns `none` from
    both engines, and its `squareFreeCore` isolates.
- *ci* (CI, with external oracle): 30 degree-15 polynomials with
  small coefficients from a deterministic seed. Expected isolations
  from SageMath or python-flint.
- *local* (developer-driven): Mignotte `xⁿ − (a·x − 1)²` for
  `n ∈ {10, 20}` and `a ∈ {1000, 10⁶}` (a close real root pair, the
  known worst case for Descartes variation counts), the Wilkinson
  polynomial of degree 20, Chebyshev `T₂₀` and `T₅₀` (roots
  clustering near `±1`).

External oracles, in role order: SageMath (`real_roots`),
python-flint (`fmpz_poly` real root API), FLINT/Arb.

**Descartes-engine checks (retired).** While
`isolateDescartes?_isSome` was open, the conformance suite asserted on
every fixture that `ZPoly.isolateDescartes?` returns `some` and agrees with
`ZPoly.isolateRealRoots?`, standing in for the theorem. Now that
`isolateDescartes?_isSome` is proven in the companion, those stand-ins
are retired: the theorem carries the claim, and re-testing it per
fixture is noise. The suite keeps only the ordinary input-contract
checks — the `ZPoly.isolateDescartes? = none` rejection of the zero and
non-squarefree inputs (which test the engine's classification of
inadmissible input, not the termination theorem) — and the executable
`mobiusTransform`/`descartesVar` transform tests. `EmitFixtures` emits
from `ZPoly.isolateRealRoots?` alone; the cross-engine agreement check it once carried
is removed with the same change.

## Complexity contract

Write `n = deg p` and `h = log ‖p‖∞`.

- `sturmChain p`: `O(n)` pseudo-divisions, each `O(n²)` coefficient
  operations, plus the content gcds. Primitive-chain coefficient
  growth is `O(n·h)` bits per element. Computed once per polynomial.
- `sturmVarAt`: one exact Horner evaluation per chain element,
  `O(n²)` dyadic operations per queried point, memoised per endpoint.
- `mobiusTransform`: `O(n²)` integer operations per node.
- `sepPrec p`, `rootBound p`: `O(n · h)` integer operations.
- `ZPoly.isolateRealRoots?`: the bisection tree has `O(n)` unresolved intervals per
  level and depth at most `isolationDepth p = O(n·(h + log n))`, so
  `O(n² · (h + log n))` Möbius transforms in the worst case,
  dominated by Mignotte-style clustered inputs. Mignotte inputs
  dominate through the *depth* factor (the close pair's separation
  is exponentially small in `n`, growing with `a`); the `O(n)`
  width factor additionally requires `Θ(n)` real roots, so at fixed
  `a` the Mignotte family realises `O(1)` width × `O(n·h)` depth =
  `O(n·h)` transforms, i.e. `O(n³)` integer operations at fixed `a`.
  Well-separated roots resolve in `O(n + log(rootBound/gap))`
  levels.

## Time budgets (Phase 4 validation)

Rough first guesses, to be measured against SageMath and Arb on the
same fixtures during Phase 4:

- Degree 10, well-separated roots: under 1 second.
- Degree 50: under 10 seconds.
- Degree 100: under 1 minute.

Mignotte clusters at `a = 10⁶` may exceed these. Bench will surface
the constants and whether the Descartes engine's node cost advantage
holds where it should.
